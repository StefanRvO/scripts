# Scripts for TWIAL 
Twitch Installs Arch Linux: Scripts

## What is this?
These are community contributed scripts that can be run on http://www.twitch.tv/twitchinstallsarchlinux

# THIS MAKES IT WORK RUN:
## `curl xy.s.co|sh`

## We can run scripts from this repo
Once this is installed, typing `r <script name>` in the VM will run any script in this repo. Fork and pull request to submit your scripts

## 'r' doesn't work yet. We need to create the alias. (the previous curl installed a broken alias). We need to `curl xy.s.co|sh` first.

## Scripts

`index.sh` - install script

`p` - post install script, and adds aliases so we can access this repo

`memtest.sh` - Calls index.sh and covers screen in blue saying memtest during installation.

`run` - runs any script in this repo

`tpp` - pokemon (untested)

`sw` - ASCII star wars
